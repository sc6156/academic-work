### MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics (awarded 2024)
* Modules:
  * [AI & Digital Technology](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Modules/AI%20%26%20Digital%20Technology) - This folder contains an essay I wrote titled ***An Overview of Support Vector Machines, Their Applications, and Their Use Cases in Law Enforcement***.
  * [Data Modelling & Analytics](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Modules/Data%20Modelling%20%26%20Analytics) - In the final assessment for this module we were required to design and create a database for a fictional property website using entity-relationship diagrams, logical designs and Oracle SQL. We were also required to conduct data mining on a credit card dataset, using machine learning models to predict whether customers would default. The assessment requirements and my submission can be found in this folder.
  * [Object Orientated Programming](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Modules/OOP%20-%20Sokoban) - The final assessment for this module required us to design and implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java for the puzzle game Sokoban, using model code provided by the tutor. This folder contains my final code and a report detailing my solution, as well as a jar file I created after the module which can be used to run the game.
  * [Secure Web Design](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Modules/Secure%20Web%20Design%20-%20Coorie) - This folder contains the code that I used to create a fictional holiday lettings website from scratch using HTML, CSS, PHP and some JavaScript (unfortunately it is no longer online as it was hosted on University-provided servers). It also contains a UX report that I created to help me design the site and a report I wrote about the security of the web application.  
  * [Statistics & Business Intelligence](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Modules/Statistics%20%26%20Business%20Intelligence) -
  * XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -
    
* [Research Project](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main/MSc/Research%20Project) - This folder contains the report for my final research project, which documents how I fine-tuned transformer-based text summarisation models (LongT5 and LED) on a child protection dataset that I created from the [NSPCC's case review collection](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/case-reviews/national-case-review-repository). This custom dataset is hosted on the [Hugging Face platform](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scott156/NSPCC_dataset)* and the code I used to fine-tune and test the models was written in Google Colab. Links to the Colab notebooks can be found in the folder inside a docx file.

\* *Please be aware that this custom dataset contains anonymised reports that document cases where children have come to harm which many people will find upsetting.*
